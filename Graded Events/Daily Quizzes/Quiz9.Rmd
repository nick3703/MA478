Consider the data from my previous semester teaching MA206. Is there evidence that Cadets in my H Hour respond differently to the question "Did this Course Help my Creativity" than my I Hour?

Present your fitted model along with 95\% confidence interval for the odds ratio between my two sections. Is there a difference between the two sections? Provide the statistic you used to answer the question, and how you arrived at your conclusion?
