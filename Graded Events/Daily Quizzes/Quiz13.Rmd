Consider the Chicago burglary dataset available at:


```{r}
library(tidyverse)

Chi_dat <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nick3703/Chicago-Data/master/crime.csv")

```


Sum the data over all spatial locations so you have a single observation for each month. Fit an intercept only model to this dataset with an independent error structure, a compound symmetry error, and an AR(1) error structure.  Write out the most appropriate model and provide parameter estimates.
