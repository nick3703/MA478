The dataset `suicide` from `library(faraway)` contains one year of suicide data from the UK cross-classified by sex age and method.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Determine if there is a relationship between the variables (i.e. are they independent of one another?)
  \item Collapse sex and age into a single six-level factor containing all combinations of sex and age. Conduct a correspondence analysis and give an interpretation of the plot. (Different ways to do this, but  `sex:age` may be helpful)  

  
\end{itemize}
